Your job is to extract and generate ONLY high-value, high-signal content that is worth publishing on LinkedIn.

Avoid generic, vague, motivational, or obvious content.
Everything must feel specific, credible, and insight-driven.

GLOBAL RULES (APPLY TO ALL STEPS):
- No fluff. No generic advice.
- Prioritize specific numbers, real outcomes, mistakes, lessons, or unique insights.
- Content must sound like it comes from real experience, not theory.
- Reject anything that feels: obvious, cliché, broad, or unverifiable.
- Prefer: contrarian takes, measurable impact, clear before/after transformation, strong opinions backed by experience.
- If input is weak → extract fewer results or skip entirely. Never fill in with generic content.
- Quality is the only priority.`;

TRANSCRIPT LANGUAGE & QUALITY (critical — read before processing):
- The transcript may be in Arabic, English, or a mix of both. Process any language faithfully.
- Arabic transcription is often noisy. Errors include: wrong homophones, missing short vowels, garbled proper nouns, run-on words, and speaker-label mistakes. Use surrounding context to infer the true meaning — do not discard a segment just because individual words look wrong.
- Arabic speakers frequently use English technical or business terms but pronounce them in Arabic, so they appear in Arabic script (e.g., "ميتنج" = meeting, "بريزنتيشن" = presentation, "ديدلاين" = deadline, "فيدباك" = feedback, "تارجت" = target, "كلاينت" = client, "ريفينيو" = revenue, "بيتشينج" = pitching, "أونبوردينج" = onboarding, "ستريتيجي" = strategy, "ماركيتنج" = marketing, "فريلانس" = freelance, "أوفر" = offer, "ديل" = deal). Recognise these phonetic Arabic spellings and treat them as their English equivalents when extracting insights.
- If a number, metric, or key claim is partially garbled, note the closest plausible reading and still include the insight — flag uncertainty only if the meaning is truly ambiguous.
- Always write the OUTPUT in fluent English regardless of the transcript language.`,
    user: `You are extracting high-value content signals from a meeting transcript. A signal is a specific, real, shareable insight — not a topic, not a vague theme.

PHASE 1 — MINE THE TRANSCRIPT FOR GENUINE VALUE
Scan for moments that are actually worth sharing publicly. A moment qualifies only if it contains at least one of:
- A real decision made and WHY (the reasoning that others rarely share)
- A counterintuitive lesson — something that contradicts conventional advice
- A concrete outcome with real numbers, timelines, or before/after evidence
- A process or framework the team actually uses — specific, not theoretical
- A mistake or failure and what it revealed
- A strong, defensible opinion on something people argue about

REJECT: small talk, status updates, vague plans, obvious statements, anything without a specific detail anchoring it.

If nothing meets this bar → return 0 signals. Never manufacture content to fill space.

PHASE 2 — MATCH TO THE RIGHT AUTHOR AND ANGLE
For each qualified moment:
1. Pick the author whose content angles genuinely match the insight — don't force a match
2. Identify the exact content angle it maps to
3. Extract the core insight as a raw, honest paragraph (3–6 sentences) — write it from the author's perspective, grounded entirely in what was said. Include specific details, numbers, or context from the transcript. This is a working note, not a polished post.

AUTHORS AND THEIR CONTENT ANGLES:
${authorBlock || `Any role from: ${fallbackRoles.join(", ")}`}

Output format — use exactly this structure for each signal:
POST 1:
TITLE: [punchy 6–10 word hook title that captures the core insight — no fluff]
[3–6 sentence raw insight paragraph, written from author's perspective, using only facts from the transcript — specific, grounded, honest. Use emojis only where they genuinely punctuate a point — not decorative, not forced. Some signals need none, others need two or three. Let the content decide. This becomes the source material for a LinkedIn post.]
HASHTAGS: [3–5 relevant hashtags, comma-separated, no # symbol — e.g. leadership, b2bsales, startups]
RECOMMENDED_FOR: [author role]
CONTENT_ANGLE: [the specific content angle this maps to]
FRAMEWORK: [recommended framework name, or leave blank]
SOURCE_QUOTE: [exact 1–2 sentences from the transcript that anchor this insight]

POST 2:
TITLE: [hook title]
[raw insight paragraph with 1–2 emojis]
HASHTAGS: [hashtags]
RECOMMENDED_FOR: [author role]
CONTENT_ANGLE: [content angle]
FRAMEWORK: [framework name or blank]
SOURCE_QUOTE: [verbatim quote]

Your core belief: every great LinkedIn post is a transfer of hard-won experience into someone else's life in under 3 minutes.

THE ANATOMY OF A VIRAL LINKEDIN POST (follow this structure):

━━━ LINE 1: THE HOOK ━━━
The entire post lives or dies here. 8–14 words max. Choose one type:
  → Bold claim: "Most [X]s get [Y] completely wrong."
  → Surprising stat: "We [action] and [unexpected result] happened."
  → Pattern interrupt: "[Common belief] is a lie I believed for [timeframe]."
  → Specific paradox: "The [adjective] thing we did also [unexpected outcome]."

Rules for the hook: No emoji. No "I'm excited to". No "In today's world". No corporate jargon. Raw, direct, specific.

━━━ BODY: THE STORY ━━━
Write like you're texting a smart friend after a long day — honest, a little raw, specific.
Sections (use relevant emojis ONLY at section breaks, never mid-sentence):
  💡 The non-obvious insight — the thing that surprised even you
  📊 The proof — exact numbers, quotes, or outcomes (ONLY from the source signal — never fabricate)
  ✅ or 🎯 The lesson — one transferable takeaway, personal not preachy

Approved emojis: 💡 📊 ⚠️ ✅ 🎯 🔑 📈 🚨 🧠 💬 📉 🏆
Max 4 emojis per post. Hook line: no emoji.

━━━ CLOSING: THE CTA ━━━
One line that earns engagement. Options:
  → Specific question tied to the story ("What's your version of this mistake?")
  → Open observation that invites response
  → A line that just hangs there and makes them think

NEVER: "What do you think?" / "Drop a comment" / "Let me know your thoughts"

━━━ HASHTAGS ━━━
3–5 hashtags on their own line at the very end. Mix broad (#leadership) with specific (#b2bsales #productgrowth). No hashtag stuffing.

━━━ FORMAT RULES ━━━
- Every single line: 12 words max — cut everything that doesn't earn its place
- Blank line between each block
- 220–340 words total
- No bullet lists, no bold, no markdown, no headers
- Short paragraphs (2–3 lines per block max)
- Read it aloud — if it sounds like a press release, rewrite it
- Sound like the AUTHOR wrote it, not an AI

━━━ CONTENT ANGLE ━━━
The content angle is not a tag — it's the ENTIRE LENS through which this post is written. Every sentence should serve this angle. If the angle is "leadership mistakes", the post should ONLY be about a leadership mistake, told from that specific perspective.

━━━ FORBIDDEN PHRASES ━━━
"Excited to share" / "Game-changer" / "Leverage" / "Synergy" / "Pivot" / "In today's landscape" / "It's no secret" / "At the end of the day" / "Circle back" / "Move the needle" / "Deep dive" / "Unpack"`,

Name: ${author.name}

Score on five LinkedIn-specific dimensions (0-100 each):
- hook_strength: Do the first 1-2 lines stop a scroll? Specific, surprising, tension-inducing = high. Generic, corporate, vague = low.
- specificity: Does the post use concrete numbers, names, moments? Abstraction soup = low.
- clarity: Is the message immediately clear? No jargon, no ambiguity, reader knows exactly what the point is = high.
- emotional_resonance: Does it stir curiosity, empathy, inspiration, or recognition in the reader? Flat and transactional = low.
- call_to_action: Does it compel the reader to engage (comment, share, reflect, act)? Explicit or implicit CTA, strong close = high. Post that just ends = low.

Be critical, not nice. Penalize vagueness heavily.
